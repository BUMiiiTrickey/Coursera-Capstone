## Business Problem
Leo is an owner of the Hotpot restaurant chain in China. Recently, his daughter came to Toronto to pursue her master's degree, so Leo decides to expand his business to Canada and move to Toronto with her daughter to take good care of her. Since Leo is not very good at English, he'd like to live in a neighbourhood where many Chinese people gather. However, since he also needs to make a living, he didn't want to open his hotpot restaurant in the places where too many Chinese restaurants existed, because too many competitors will make the business to be hard-hitting.So we need to help him find the place where is good to live and the other place for his business where is not very far away from home but without too many Chinese restaurants.
